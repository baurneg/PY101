Write out pseudocode (both casual and formal) that does 
the following:

- a function that returns the sum of two numbers

- given two numbers
- add two numbers
- 

START 
# given two numbers
num1 and num2
GET sum = num1 + num2
PRINT sum 


- a function that takes a list of strings, and returns 
- a string that is all those strings concatenated 
- together
- 
# given list of strings - str_list
# new_string = ''
# iterate over list and join each string into one list
START 

SET index = 0 # first element of list
WHILE index <= length of str_list
    SET new_string + element
    SET index += 1 # increment by one
PRINT new_string


a function that takes a list of integers, and returns 
a new list with every other element from the original 
list, starting with the first element. For instance:
every_other([1,4,7,2,5]) # => [1,7,5]

# given list of integers
# print every other element in the list
START 
SET iterator = 0
WHILE iterator <= length of the list 
    PRINT even index
